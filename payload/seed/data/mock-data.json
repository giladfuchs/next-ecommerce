          "question": "Which trees are best suited for smaller urban gardens?",
          "answer": "Compact species like the Malisi Pomegranate or pruned Bay Laurel are ideal, as they provide vertical interest without an aggressive root system."

          "question": "How often should I water newly planted trees?",
          "answer": "Newly planted trees require deep watering 1–2 times per week to ensure the root ball establishes deep in the soil, especially during the first two summers."
