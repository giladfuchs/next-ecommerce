## 🚀 Getting Started (for Local Development)

This project supports multiple development modes:

- **Fullstack** — run a real backend with PostgreSQL + Express
- **Next.js API** — use serverless functions instead of Express
- **Mock** — use local mock data for instant setup

Choose the guide that fits your workflow:

- [🛍️ `frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md) — run the frontend with mock data or connect to a backend
- [🛠️ `backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) — set up the Express API and database
- [⚙️ `functions/README.md`](functions/README.md) — uses Next.js API routes for backend logic (no separate server needed)
